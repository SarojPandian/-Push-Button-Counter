## Description

+ The aim of this project is to design an embedded system that uses a microcontroller to precisely count and display the number of times a push button was pressed.  The mechanical "bouncing" of the button, which can produce many counts for one push, is the main problem using such devices. Software-based debouncing techniques are used to get around problem and guarantee precise and accurate counting.

+ The system uses a digital input pin to detect the button press. A debounce routine is incorporated using delay to filter out spurious signals caused by bouncing. Each valid press increments a counter, which is then displayed on an output interface, 16x2 LCD screen.

+ This project demonstrates key embedded system principles like output display, software debouncing, digital input processing, and real-time counting.

## Software Used

1. Proteus 8 Professional
   - A professional-level circuit simulation software used to simulate microcontroller-based projects. It allows real-time visualization of the embedded system's functionality without needing physical hardware. It supports direct import of > .hex files generated from Arduino IDE for simulation.
